# biryani.js

Experimentation around data conversion and validation using transducers.

Port of [biryani](https://pythonhosted.org/Biryani/) Python library in JavaScript.

Based on the [transducers.js](https://github.com/jlongster/transducers.js) library, but may be compatible with others.

## Development

Since the browsers have convinient debuggers, I like to develop in the browser:

```
npm run dev
```

Open in your browser http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/biryani

## Tests

```
npm run test
```
